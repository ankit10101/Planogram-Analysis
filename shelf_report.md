### Recommendations from the Market Analyst and Action Plan

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Re-organization by Product Type:**
   - Today’s consumer looks for specific snack types, e.g., healthy vs. indulgent. Organizing by product type rather than purely by brand improves customer navigation and satisfaction.

2. **Enhanced Product Visibility:**
   - Front-facing product alignment ensures maximum visibility and brand recognition. Remove any sideways or misaligned products and maintain a consistent layout.

3. **Optimal Space Utilization:**
   - Implement shelf dividers for a neat and organized look, maintaining clear boundaries between different snack brands and types.

4. **Stock Rotation and Updates:**
   - Regularly update stock to avoid the appearance of an empty shelf while also preventing overcrowding.

5. **Prominent Placement of Healthier Options:**
   - Due to growing health trends, display healthier snack options at eye level to encourage sales of these items.

6. **Promotion of Private Label and Sustainable Options:**
   - Incorporate private label and sustainably-sourced brands, emphasizing them through signage or promotions.

**Practical Implementation Steps for Store Manager and Store Buyer:**

1. **Re-organizing Shelves:**
   - Categorize snacks into sections like health-conscious, indulgent, and on-the-go. Allocate sections on shelves starting from eye level down.
   - Use visual tools to ensure the layout translates well physically.

2. **Visibility and Alignment:**
   - Conduct periodic checks to make sure products remain front-facing. Train staff on maintaining consistency in product placement.

3. **Space and Shelf Utilization:**
   - Introduce dividers and updated labels for clearer identification. Coordinate with space planners on optimized layouts specific to your store’s dimensions.

4. **Coordinate Stocking Protocols:**
   - Establish a schedule for stock updates and align with the supply chain for regular rotation and stock level checks.

5. **Leverage Signage and Promotions:**
   - Implement promotional end caps that highlight healthier options or private labels. Use digital signage to emphasize trends or new arrivals.

6. **Digital and Social Media Engagement:**
   - Add displays or QR codes on shelves that connect customers to online recipes or snack trends, driving more interactive in-store experiences.

These steps aim to enhance consumer experience, integrate market trends, and ultimately drive higher sales and satisfaction within the store.
